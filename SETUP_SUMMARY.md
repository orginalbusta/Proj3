## 💡 Key Insights & Design Decisions

### Why Choropleth Map?

✅ **Geographic context** - Health outcomes are location-dependent  
✅ **Pattern recognition** - Easy to spot regional disparities  
✅ **Scalability** - Shows all 3000+ counties simultaneously  
✅ **Familiarity** - Users understand geographic representations  

### Why These Interactions?

**Year Slider:**
- Enables temporal pattern discovery
- User-controlled (better than auto-play)
- Shows trends over 11 years

**Metric Selector:**
- Multiple perspectives on health
- Dynamic queries technique
- Reveals correlations

**Hover Tooltips:**
- Details-on-demand pattern
- Keeps visualization uncluttered
- Provides exact values

**Zoom & Pan:**
- Handles visual density
- Allows detailed exploration
- Focuses on regions of interest

### Alternatives Considered & Rejected

❌ **Scatter Plot Matrix** - Loses geographic context  
❌ **Small Multiples** - Too small to show detail  
❌ **Bubble Map** - Visual clutter with 3000+ counties  
❌ **Animated Transitions** - Less user control than slider  

---

## 📈 Expected Performance

### With Sample Data (Current)
- Loads instantly
- Smooth interactions
- 8 counties with data
- 2014-2024 years available

### With Real Data (After Download)
- ~100KB CSV file
- 3000+ counties
- 11 years of data
- Should still load in <2 seconds
- Smooth 60fps transitions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Reference

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Map doesn't appear  
**Solution:** Use local server (`python -m http.server 8000`)

**Issue:** CORS errors  
**Solution:** Must use server, not open file directly

**Issue:** Counties are gray  
**Solution:** Sample data only has 8 counties (expected)

**Issue:** Python script errors  
**Solution:** Windows encoding issues - all fixed ✅

**Issue:** Data won't load  
**Solution:** Check file path, ensure in `data/` folder
