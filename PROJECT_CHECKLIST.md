## Tips for a Great Project

### Design
1. **Focus on a compelling question** - What story does the data tell?
2. **Keep it simple** - Better to do a few things well than many things poorly
3. **Test with real users** - Have someone try your visualization
4. **Iterate** - First version won't be perfect

### Implementation
1. **Start with sample data** - Easier to debug
2. **Use browser DevTools** - Console is your friend
3. **Commit often** - Save your progress frequently
4. **Test early and often** - Don't wait until the end

### Writeup
1. **Be specific** - "We chose green because..." not "Green looked nice"
2. **Show your thinking** - Explain alternatives you considered
3. **Be honest** - It's okay to mention challenges
4. **Use examples** - Reference specific features

3. **What alternatives did you consider?** (other chart types, other interactions)
4. **How did you divide the work?**
5. **How much time did you spend?** (be specific)
6. **What took the most time?** (data cleaning? D3 learning? debugging?)
7. **What was most challenging?**
8. **What interesting patterns did you find?**
