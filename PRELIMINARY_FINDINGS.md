## Data Overview

### Dataset Characteristics

- **Source**: County Health Rankings & Roadmaps
- **Geographic Coverage**: U.S. counties (3,000+ counties)
- **Temporal Coverage**: 2014-2024 (11 years)
- **Metrics**: 15+ health indicators
- **Format**: CSV with FIPS codes for geographic linking

### Sample Data Structure

```
fips,county,state,year,life_expectancy,premature_death,adult_obesity,...
06037,Los Angeles,California,2024,75.1,5636,35.0,...
06073,San Diego,California,2024,72.0,5585,28.0,...
```

### Key Columns Identified

- **fips**: 5-digit county FIPS code (for geographic mapping)
- **county**: County name
- **state**: State name
- **year**: Year of data collection
- **15 health metrics**: Various health outcomes and factors

---

## Visualization Design Recommendations

### 1. Primary Visualization: Choropleth Map

**Rationale:**
- Geographic patterns are critical for understanding health disparities
- Counties are the natural unit of analysis in the dataset
- Color encoding effectively shows quantitative differences
- Familiar to general audiences

**Implementation:**
- Use D3.js with TopoJSON for efficient rendering
- U.S. Atlas provides county boundaries
- Sequential color scales for metrics (light = better, dark = worse for negative metrics)

### 2. Interaction Techniques

Based on the assignment requirements and data characteristics, we recommend:

#### A. Temporal Navigation (Year Slider)
- **Purpose**: Explore trends over 2014-2024
- **Technique**: Range slider with year display
- **Benefit**: Enables temporal pattern discovery
- **Implementation**: D3.js slider updates map on change

#### B. Dynamic Query Filters (Metric Selector)
- **Purpose**: Compare different health indicators
- **Technique**: Dropdown menu with 6-8 key metrics
- **Benefit**: Multiple perspectives on health outcomes
- **Implementation**: Re-color counties based on selected metric

#### C. Details-on-Demand (Hover Tooltips)
- **Purpose**: Show exact values without cluttering
- **Technique**: Mouse hover reveals county details
- **Benefit**: Maintains clean overview while providing specifics
- **Implementation**: D3.js mouseover events with positioned div

#### D. Geographic Focus (State Filter)
- **Purpose**: Focus on specific regions
- **Technique**: Optional state dropdown filter
- **Benefit**: Reduces visual complexity for detailed analysis
- **Implementation**: Filter data and update map

#### E. Zoom & Pan
- **Purpose**: Detailed exploration of dense regions
- **Technique**: D3.js zoom behavior
- **Benefit**: Handle visual density in small counties
- **Implementation**: SVG transform on zoom/drag

### 3. Recommended Metrics for Visualization

Based on data completeness and interpretability:

**High Priority (Include These):**
1. **Life Expectancy** - Primary health outcome, easily understood
2. **Adult Obesity** - Key health behavior, complete data
3. **Median Household Income** - Socioeconomic factor, shows disparities
4. **Premature Death Rate** - Alternative outcome measure
5. **Unemployment** - Economic health indicator
6. **Diabetes Prevalence** - Chronic disease indicator

**Medium Priority (Consider Adding):**
7. Adult Smoking
8. Physical Inactivity
9. High School Graduation
10. Uninsured Rate

## Data Processing Workflow

### For Real Data Implementation

1. **Download Data**
   - Visit: https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data
   - Download "National Data & Documentation"
   - Look for trend files with multi-year data

2. **Explore Structure**
   ```bash
   python explore_data.py
   ```

3. **Convert to D3 Format**
   ```bash
   python convert_data.py
   ```

4. **Validate**
   - Check FIPS codes are 5 digits
   - Verify years are present
   - Confirm metric columns exist
   - Test with small sample first

5. **Optimize**
   - Filter to essential columns
   - Remove incomplete records (or handle gracefully)
   - Consider aggregating if file is too large

## Anticipated Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Data Size
**Issue**: Full dataset could be 100,000+ rows (3000 counties × 11 years × metrics)

**Solutions:**
- Filter to fewer years if needed (e.g., 2015, 2018, 2021, 2024)
- Serve compressed JSON instead of CSV
- Implement lazy loading by year
- Use TopoJSON quantization to reduce geometry size

### Challenge 2: Missing Data
**Issue**: Not all counties have data for all metrics/years

**Solutions:**
- Display missing counties in gray
- Show "N/A" in tooltips
- Exclude from statistics calculations
- Document data completeness in writeup

### Challenge 3: Performance
**Issue**: Rendering 3000+ SVG paths can be slow

**Solutions:**
- Use D3's optimized data joins
- Implement transition delays strategically
- Consider Canvas rendering for very large datasets
- Optimize update cycles

### Challenge 4: Visual Density
**Issue**: Small counties (especially in Northeast) are hard to see

**Solutions:**
- Enable zoom and pan (implemented ✓)
- Consider Alaska/Hawaii repositioning
- Use stroke highlighting on hover
- Possibly implement inset maps for dense regions

## Design Alternatives & Justifications

### What We Chose: Choropleth Map

**Pros:**
- Geographic context preserved
- All counties visible simultaneously
- Color encoding is intuitive
- Supports pattern discovery

**Cons:**
- Small counties hard to see
- Area bias (large counties more prominent)
- Requires geographic knowledge

### Alternative 1: Hexbin Map

**Pros:**
- Equal visual weight per county
- Less geographic distortion

**Cons:**
- Loses familiar geography
- Harder to implement
- Less intuitive for general users

**Decision**: Stick with choropleth, use zoom to address density

### Alternative 2: Bubble Map

**Pros:**
- Can encode multiple variables (size + color)
- Emphasizes outliers

**Cons:**
- Visual clutter with 3000+ bubbles
- Overlap issues
- Harder to see patterns

**Decision**: Choropleth is cleaner for this use case

### Alternative 3: Small Multiples (Multiple Year Maps)

**Pros:**
- See all years at once
- Easy comparison

**Cons:**
- Each map would be tiny
- Can't show as much detail
- Requires more screen space

**Decision**: Year slider provides better detail and user control

## Recommended Visualization Workflow for Users

### Exploratory Path

1. **Overview First**
   - Start with Life Expectancy, 2024
   - Observe overall geographic patterns
   - Identify regions of interest

2. **Temporal Exploration**
   - Use year slider to see trends
   - Look for changes over time
   - Note counties improving/declining

3. **Multi-Metric Analysis**
   - Switch between metrics
   - Look for correlations (e.g., income vs. life expectancy)
   - Identify complex patterns

4. **Detailed Investigation**
   - Hover over specific counties
   - Use zoom for dense regions
   - Compare neighboring counties

5. **State-Level Focus**
   - Filter to specific states
   - Do within-state comparisons
   - Identify intra-state disparities

## Key Insights to Highlight

Once real data is loaded, look for these patterns to highlight:

### Expected Patterns
1. **Coastal vs. Interior Divide**: Coastal counties often have better outcomes
2. **Urban vs. Rural**: Urban areas often have better healthcare access
3. **Regional Clusters**: Health outcomes cluster by region (e.g., Southeast)
4. **Socioeconomic Correlation**: Income strongly predicts health outcomes
5. **Temporal Trends**: Overall improvements in some metrics, declines in others

### Interesting Questions for Users

- Which counties have improved most over time?
- Are health disparities widening or narrowing?
- How does your county compare to neighbors?
- What's the relationship between economic and health outcomes?
- Which states have the most intra-state variation?

## Questions for Professor/TA

Before proceeding, consider clarifying:

1. Is it acceptable to focus on a subset of years if full dataset is too large?
2. Should we handle Alaska/Hawaii repositioning, or is mainland U.S. sufficient?
3. Are there specific metrics the course would like emphasized?
4. What's the expected level of statistical analysis in the visualization?
