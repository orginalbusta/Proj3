## Technical Details

### Data Structure
The CSV now includes a `year` column:
```csv
fips,county,state,year,life_expectancy,premature_death,...
01001,Autauga County,Alabama,2020,75.8,8234,...
01001,Autauga County,Alabama,2021,76.1,8120,...
01001,Autauga County,Alabama,2022,76.3,8050,...
01001,Autauga County,Alabama,2023,76.5,7980,...
01001,Autauga County,Alabama,2024,76.8,7900,...
```

### Modal State Management
- `selectedCountyFips`: Stores currently selected county FIPS code
- `modalYear`: Tracks the year shown in the modal (2020-2024)
- Data is queried dynamically as the year slider changes

### Performance
- Modal renders instantly (no network requests)
- Year slider updates are smooth with no lag
- All 13 metrics are formatted and displayed in real-time

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Add sparklines/charts** showing trends within the modal
2. **Compare mode** - click multiple counties to compare
3. **Export data** button to download county time series
4. **Integrate real PLACES data** from the CSV files in the data folder
5. **Add county rankings** (e.g., "This county ranks #450 out of 3,159")

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Click on any county
3. Move the year slider back and forth
4. Verify all metrics update correctly
5. Try closing the modal using different methods
6. Test with counties in different states

## Known Behaviors

- **Data Variation**: Currently, years 2020-2023 have synthetic variations (±5%) based on 2024 data
- **Missing Data**: Some counties may show "N/A" for certain metrics
- **County Highlight**: Clicked county is highlighted in red until modal closes
- **Main Map**: Stays at year 2024 (the year slider on the page is hidden)
