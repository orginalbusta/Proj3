# Current Working Visualization (Baseline)

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and functional  
**Live URL:** https://orginalbusta.github.io/Proj3/  
**Type:** Single-metric choropleth map

## What It Does

A basic interactive county-level health map with dropdown selection and details-on-demand.

### Features:

#### 1. Single Metric View
- **Dropdown selector:** Choose from 12 health/socioeconomic metrics
- **Map updates instantly** with new color scale
- **Sequential color encoding:** Darker = higher values

#### 2. Hover Interaction
- **Tooltip displays:**
  - County name + state
  - Metric value with units
- **Visual feedback:** Border highlight on hover

#### 3. Click-to-Explore Modal
- **Click any county** → Opens detailed view
- **Displays all 12 metrics** for selected county in one panel
- **Red border** highlights selected county on map
- **Close button** or click outside to dismiss

#### 4. Dynamic Legend
- Updates with selected metric
- Shows gradient scale with min/max labels
- Displays metric title and units

## Technical Implementation

**D3.js Components:**
- `d3.geoAlbersUsa()` - Map projection
- `d3.scaleSequential()` - Color scales
- `d3.interpolate*()` - Color schemes (Blues, Greens, Reds, etc.)
- Event listeners - hover, click interactions

**Data:**
- `county_health_data.csv` - 3,159 counties × 12 metrics (2024 data)
- TopoJSON - U.S. county boundaries

**Files:**
- `index.html` - Structure
- `script.js` - D3.js logic
- `styles.css` - Styling

| **Health Behaviors** | Obesity, Smoking, Physical Inactivity, Diabetes, Excessive Drinking |
| **Socioeconomic** | Median Income, HS Graduation |
| **Clinical Care** | Uninsured Rate, Primary Care Physicians |

## Limitations (Why We Need to Enhance)

❌ **Shows only one metric at a time** - Can't see relationships  
❌ **No comparison capability** - Can't explore correlations  
❌ **Doesn't use exploratory analysis** - RF model, scatter plots are disconnected  
❌ **No advanced interactions** - No brushing, filtering, or linked views  
❌ **Obvious patterns only** - Doesn't reveal insights beyond "wealthier = healthier"

## Next Steps

Choose and implement one of the 4 enhanced visualization options from `CHECKPOINT_SUBMISSION.md`:

1. **Deviation Map** - Show counties that defy economic predictions
2. **Bivariate Choropleth** - Show two metrics simultaneously
3. **Linked Multi-View** - Coordinated maps + scatter plot
4. **Clustering Map** - Group counties into health archetypes
