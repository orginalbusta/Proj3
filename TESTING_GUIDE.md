# Testing the County Modal Feature

## 🎯 Quick Test Checklist

### 1. Refresh Your Browser
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
URL: http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Test County Click
- [x] Click on **California** (large state, easy target)
- [x] Modal should pop up showing "Los Angeles County" or similar
- [x] Should see county name in large text at the top
- [x] Should see state name below county name

### 3. Test Year Slider
- [x] Look for the year slider showing "2024" by default
- [x] Drag slider left to **2020**
- [x] Watch metrics update dynamically
- [x] Drag slider right back to **2024**
- [x] Verify metrics change (values should be slightly different)

### 4. Test Metrics Display
Look for these metrics with icons:
- [x] 💚 Life Expectancy (should show something like "76.5 years")
- [x] 💔 Premature Death Rate (per 100,000)
- [x] 🍔 Adult Obesity (percentage)
- [x] 🚬 Adult Smoking (percentage)
- [x] 🛋️ Physical Inactivity (percentage)
- [x] 🩺 Diabetes (percentage)
- [x] 🍺 Excessive Drinking (percentage)
- [x] 🤒 Poor Health (percentage)
- [x] 💰 Median Household Income (dollar amount)
- [x] 🎓 High School Graduation (percentage)
- [x] 💼 Unemployment (percentage or "N/A")
- [x] 👨‍⚕️ Primary Care Physicians (per 100k residents)
- [x] 🏥 Uninsured (percentage)

### 5. Test Modal Closing
Try all these methods:
- [x] Click the **×** button (top right)
- [x] Click **outside the modal** (on the dark overlay)
- [x] Press the **Escape key** on your keyboard

### 6. Test Multiple Counties
Try clicking different counties:
- [x] **New York** (northeast)
- [x] **Texas** (south)
- [x] **Colorado** (mountain west)
- [x] **Florida** (southeast)

Each should:
- Show different county names
- Display unique data
- Maintain year slider functionality

### 7. Test Visual Feedback
- [x] Hover over a county → Should turn dark with thicker border
- [x] Click a county → Should turn **red** with thick border
- [x] Close modal → Red border should disappear
- [x] Main map should remain at year 2024

## 🐛 What to Look For

### Expected Behaviors ✅
- Modal appears smoothly with fade-in animation
- Year slider updates metrics instantly (no lag)
- Closing modal removes red highlight
- Cursor changes to pointer when hovering over counties
- All metrics show formatted values (e.g., "$65,432" not "65432")

### Potential Issues ❌
- **Modal doesn't open**: Check browser console (F12) for errors
- **Metrics show "N/A"**: Some counties may legitimately lack data
- **Year slider doesn't work**: Try clicking other counties
- **Modal won't close**: Try refreshing the page

## 📊 Example Expected Values

**For a typical county in 2024:**
- Life Expectancy: 72-78 years
- Premature Death: 6,000-12,000 per 100k
- Adult Obesity: 28-38%
- Median Income: $40,000-$80,000
- HS Graduation: 80-92%

**Differences between years:**
- Values should vary by ±2-7% between 2020 and 2024
- Trends may be synthetic but should look realistic

## 🎨 Visual Design Check

### Modal Appearance
- [ ] Clean white background
- [ ] Rounded corners
- [ ] Drop shadow for depth
- [ ] County name in large, bold blue text
- [ ] Year slider in highlighted box
- [ ] Metrics in organized rows with hover effects

### Animations
- [ ] Modal slides down and fades in (not instant)
- [ ] Metric rows have subtle hover effects
- [ ] Smooth transitions when changing years

## 🚀 Advanced Testing

### Performance Test
1. Click on 10 different counties rapidly
2. Modal should open/close smoothly each time
3. No lag or freezing

### Stress Test
1. Open modal
2. Rapidly slide year slider back and forth
3. Metrics should update smoothly without flickering

### Edge Cases
- Click on Alaska (might have different data)
- Click on Hawaii (island counties)
- Try small rural counties vs. large urban counties
